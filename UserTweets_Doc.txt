*********** subject
this class brings all tweets of each user together into one single big file.

*********** Details

*** [14,21] at first it indexes all files in a given directory.

*** [23, 44] each file contains the data of a specific user, in more details: user's id & name (in first object),
	followers(in second object), friends(in third object) and all tweets that each one is in a seperate object.
	for example a file that contains a user with 3 tweets is s.th like this:

	[
		{id, name},
		{followers},
		{friends},
		{tweet-1},
		{tweet-2},
		{tweet-3},
	]


	NOTE: in some files, this array is duplicated, probably by mistake.

	so here i filter this data into this json format:
	[
		id1: {
			name1,
			id1,
			tweets: {
				tweet1,
				tweet2,
				...
			},
			tweets_count
		},
		id2: {
			name2,
			id2,
			tweets: {
				tweet1,
				tweet2,
				...
			},
			tweets_count
		},
		...
	]
